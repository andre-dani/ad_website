ideas:
type that reacts (changes colour) to the background image? too fancy?

prompts:

I need your help to create a website. It should work as a kind of business card online. A simple place where people can know a little bit about me and my work and get in touch. Here is some guidance:

— it must be fully responsible
— it needs a full bleed background with an automatic slideshow with images and potentially gifs or videos (where I can upload later)
— it needs an ‘about’ and ‘get in touch’ sections (the getting in touch must be a simple contact form)

The strucutre should be simple and clever. Ideally should look like this:

— full image as a background
— a short text with a bio in the top left hand side
— a get in touch button on the top right hand side
— a andredani.com in bold and big type at the bottom of the page

Please ask me any question you need

Hi, thanks for your help so far. Answering your questions:

1) I am a passionate brand designer with over a decade of experience, blending conceptual strategy and hands-on execution to build authentic brands that inspire positive change. An advocate for sustainability, human rights, and diversity, I thrive on collaborating with like-minded teams to create meaningful impact.

2) Actually, you can simplify it and just have a 'mailto' instead, so no form is needed.

3) yes, just use a placeholder (but you can use a picture of a cat, I love them)

4) regarding the font, if you could use Acumin Variable Concept (wide) would be great, if not, something similar. the font size for the bio could be 23pt, and for the big title 200pt. the colour I'd go for white

Thanks
